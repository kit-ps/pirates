# Pirates: Anonymous Group Calls over Fully Untrusted Infrastructure

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of the Pirates protocol for anonymous group calls accepted at ACIPS 2024.
To run the mouth-to-ear latency benchmarks presented in the paper, Docker needs to be installed on the system.
Then, run the following commands:

```
run-benchmarks.py --group-size --users
eval-logs.py
```
